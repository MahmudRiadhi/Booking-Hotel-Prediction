# Booking-Hotel-Prediction

This data set contains booking information for Resort Hotel and City Hotel. It is known that both hotels are located in Portugal (Southern Europe). More precisely, the Resort Hotel is located in the Resort Algarve area and the City Hotel is located in the city of Lisbon. The distance between these 2 locations is approx. 280km by car and the second visit location is in the North Atlantic.

In the midst of the hectic nature of managing a property, bookings can be overwhelming. Many bookings are absolutely unavoidable as guest plans change, hotels have better models to predict whether guests will actually come or not. This can help the hotel to plan things like personal needs and meals. Or provide additional facilities on the type of room booked so as to help the hotel proactively avoid this situation and generate revenue for the hotel.

## Objectives
1. Provides a variety of analysis and descriptive insights
2. Knowing what factors cause booking cancellations and reducing losses for guests who cancel bookings
3. Develop a model for the prediction of order cancellations and describe the model and its outputs

## The process to do with this project
1. Import libraries and load the data
2. Data cleansing (missing value and duplicate rows handling)
3. Exploratory data analysis (EDA) which consists of preliminary look at the data, and data deep-dive understanding (statistical summary, univariate analysis, multivariate analysis)
4. Pre-processing
5. Machine Learning Solution (binary classification task, performance metrics, hyperparameter tuning of cross validation, features importance)
6. Expected Outcome (conclusions and recommendations)
